Rotating Image Gallery
A 3D Rotating Image Gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project creates an interactive image carousel with a smooth 3D rotation effect, allowing users to browse through images using simple navigation controls.

📌 Features
3D Rotating Carousel – Images arranged in a circular layout that rotates smoothly.

Interactive Controls – Use Prev and Next buttons to rotate the gallery left or right.

Smooth Animations – CSS transitions for seamless visual effects.

Responsive Design – Works across different screen sizes.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 – Structure and markup

CSS3 – 3D transforms, animations, and styling

JavaScript – Rotation logic and user interactivity

🎯 How It Works
Images are placed in a circular arrangement using CSS rotateY and translateZ.

JavaScript changes the rotation angle by ±45° when the Prev or Next button is clicked.

A perspective effect creates the illusion of depth, making the gallery appear truly 3D.
